## Laravel4 Migration Generator

### Generate migrations based on existing tables

***You might want to checkout https://github.com/Xethron/migrations-generator which is similar to this package, but is developed more recently and is using way/generators version 2.x. My package is still on 1.x and I'll have to see when/if I can upgrade. This package does still work, but isn't actively supported currently***

Require this package in your composer.json:

    "barryvdh/laravel-migration-generator": "dev-master"

And update dependencies using composer:

    composer update

And add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in app/config/app.php

    'Barryvdh\MigrationGenerator\MigrationGeneratorServiceProvider',

You can now generate the migration by running the command, followed by the tables you want to generate

    php artisan migration-generate posts,users

Your migrations will be created in app/database/migrations

Migrations are generated by https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators
This assumes the key is 'id' and timestamps (created_at/updated_at) are generated by default.
